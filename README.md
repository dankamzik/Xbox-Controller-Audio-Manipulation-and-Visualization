# Xbox-Controller-Audio-Manipulation-and-Visualization
Welcome to my Xbox Controller Interface! Here you can sit back and relax to your favorite music all the while treating your brain to limitless color and pattern potential. This current build sports the ability to start and stop your music on command, grants the user the ability to change the page from one color to the next or have a continuous stream of color. There is also a built in shortcut for song selection as well as a beautiful sound file visualizer that moves with the music and can be manipulated with xbox buttons! Want to mess with your music? This build allows you to change the pitch of your song in real time! More features to come. Enjoy!
